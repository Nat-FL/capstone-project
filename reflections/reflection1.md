## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to complete our profile and community component (in terms of getting data to display), and add customization to our landing page!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some challenges we faced was struggling with understanding how we are going to implement our chat feature, and getting a list of users that are learning the same language.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.) 

At the beginning part of the week we put our focus into developing the chatroom feature, since we knew that feature would take us the longest to implement. However we had a lot of troubble understanding it and sought out Ashuan, Ronesha, youtube, and google for help with it. We decided to then take it off the spring plan for this week and bump it to next week, and continue with the rest of our sprint backlog. I think something we learned from this experience is to not have multiple people working on the same task at the same time since that put a halt in our sprint backlog, as well as making sure we don't spend all our day on one feature and ignoring the rest. Sometimes its better to start with features you know how to implement, so at least you'll have something done for the sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the instructors, and our advisor Ronesha was available to us to help us when we ran into a bug we couldn't figure out. Alex helped us display users on our community page, Ronesha helped us figure our the algorithm to do so, and Ashaun helped us understand socket.io a but more. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We don't consider any features or user stories at risk at the moment. Although we pushed back our chat feature, we are confident with some more research and help we will be able to finish it since it is the core of our application. Given what we learned in class the first 5 weeks and what we've done so far on Lingomates, we are confident that the rest of the tasks in our product backlog can get completed.
