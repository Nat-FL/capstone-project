## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were finally able to implemet our chat feature!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 A challenge that our group faced is that we had some differing opinions on how we want the UI to look and what the color scheme would be. We still have not really agreed and we have had to learn to compromise and come to a mutual decision as a team when we all have different opinions on something. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, we finished all our tasks.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the instructors like Ronesha and Ashuan were very helpful in implementing our chat feautre. They were patient to learn about socket.io in order to give us help and guidance and stay after hours with us to work on it. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

A feature at risk is implementing a video call feature. However we won't really have to change our plan if it remains at risk because it is a stretch feature and is not required to have an application of value.
