## Problem Statement

Learning and becoming proficient in a new language can seem like an arduous task for many people. Questions or statements like “Where do I even start with learning a new language” or “I don’t have enough time or resources to try to learn this language” plague the minds of many as they begin their journey of learning a new language. Various websites and applications offer courses that help users learn a language, but sometimes these applications cost money or the application does not offer a lot of interaction features between users. A common gap that is present throughout existing language apps is that they do not have many sociability features among users. One of the quickest and most sociable ways for people to learn or practice a language is for them to interact with natives or people who are proficient in said language. Our web application aims to close the aforementioned gap by offering a sociable service where users can interact with each other in chats or even use video chats to practice the language(s) both users want to learn. Whether you are a language enthusiast, a beginner, or a casual learner this web application offers a free method for users from different backgrounds to come together and improve their language skills. 

## User Roles
