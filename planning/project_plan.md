## Problem Statement and Description

Learning and becoming proficient in a new language can seem like an arduous task for many people. Questions or statements like “Where do I even start with learning a new language” or “I don’t have enough time or resources to try to learn this language” plague the minds of many as they begin their journey of learning a new language. Various websites and applications offer courses that help users learn a language, but sometimes these applications cost money or the application does not offer a lot of interaction features between users. A common gap that is present throughout existing language apps is that they do not have many sociability features among users. One of the quickest and most sociable ways for people to learn or practice a language is for them to interact with natives or people who are proficient in said language. Our web application aims to close the aforementioned gap by offering a sociable service where users can interact with each other in chats to practice the language(s) both users want to learn. Whether you are a language enthusiast, a beginner, or a casual learner this web application offers a free method for users from different backgrounds to come together and improve their language skills. 

The main objective of our project is to create a web application that allows users to interact and learn with each other in a social environment like a chat room. The key features of our site are that users will have the ability to befriend each other, and those users who are friends can create chats where they can chat each other in the language that they are both trying to learn. If some users do not have a common language that they can easily communicate with, our site will offer a text translator feature. This feature will allow the user to translate text into their native language if needed. The site will also offer users the ability to choose multiple languages that they can learn, and users will have a proficiency level associated with their languages based on how well they know the language. Features like the proficiency level allow users to find other users who are at a similar level, which allows these users to practice and improve their language skills if that is their main goal. The proficiency level can also allow for users to take on a mentor-mentee role and vice versa if a user wants to practice teaching other users a language while the novice student improves their skills with a proficient speaker. The app will also allow casual users who may not frequent the app as often to still participate and engage with other users through the chats. Our site is flexible to our audiences’ preferences and what they hope to accomplish in their language journey.
