## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.
Learning and becoming proficient in a new language can seem like an arduous task for many people. Questions or statements like “Where do I even start with learning a new language” or “I don’t have enough time or resources to try to learn this language” plague the minds of many as they begin their journey of learning a new language. Various websites and applications offer courses that help users learn a language, but sometimes these applications cost money or the application does not offer a lot of interaction features between users. A common gap that is present throughout existing language apps is that they do not have many sociability features among users. One of the quickest and most sociable ways for people to learn or practice a language is for them to interact with natives or people who are proficient in said language. Our web application aims to close the aforementioned gap by offering a sociable service where users can interact with each other in chats or even use video chats to practice the language(s) both users want to learn. Whether you are a language enthusiast, a beginner, or a casual learner this web application offers a free method for users from different backgrounds to come together and improve their language skills. 

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?
The main objective of our project is to create a web application that allows users to interact and learn with each other in a social environment like a chat room or a video call. The key features of our site are that users will have the ability to befriend each other, and those users who are friends can create chats where they can chat or video call each other in the language that they are both trying to learn. If some users do not have a common language that they can easily communicate with, our site will offer a text translator feature. This feature will allow the user to translate text into their native language if needed. The site will also offer users the ability to choose multiple languages that they can learn, and users will have a proficiency level associated with their languages based on how well they know the language. Features like the proficiency level allow users to find other users who are at a similar level, which allows these users to practice and improve their language skills if that is their main goal. The proficiency level can also allow for users to take on a mentor-mentee role and vice versa if a user wants to practice teaching other users a language while the novice student improves their skills with a proficient speaker. The app will also allow casual users who may not frequent the app as often to still participate and engage with other users through the chats and video call features. Our site is flexible to our audiences’ preferences and what they hope to accomplish in their language journey. 

## Expected Features List

Add a list of your groups's brainstormed features list

User Registration: Allow users to create profiles with their language proficiency level, languages they’re learning/want to chat in, name, photo etc.

Use algorithms to match users - users may choose whether they want to be matched with someone at their skill level, or at a skill level higher or lower. 

Provide messaging through app 

Allow voice and video calls using google meet for users to have real-time conversations and practice speaking skills 

Organize virtual group sessions where multiple users studying the same language can practice together.

Create interactive language challenges/quizzes/games  to engage users and help them practice their desired language [STRETCH FEATURE]

Progress Tracking: Allow users to track their language learning progress, set goals, and receive personalized recommendations.


## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?
There are a few sites similar to our proposed project, Duomingle. For example, Italki, Bilingua, HelloTalk, and Speaky allow you to connect with people from other countries and backgrounds and practice talking in a language. However, many of these sites are only available on mobile devices and not on desktop, which may be exclusive to some people who don’t have phones. Furthermore, Italki connects you with language experts, instead of allowing you to talk with peers who may be at the same skill level as you in a language. Additionally, most of these sites require you to pay to fully experience the features, while we aim to keep our site free to accommodate everyone who wants to use it. The user interface on most of the applications is a bit overwhelming and confusing, and we hope to keep our application simple and user-friendly. Additionally, maybe sites only allow you to choose one language to focus on, while our application will allow users to have multiple.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?
We need to do more research on common languages so we know what languages to include in our application. We also want to do more reasearch on our competitors and compare their applications and see what's missing in them, so we know how to best improve ours.
